# Mapworks Mouseover, Mouse-click and Zoom-to Example (Angular)

This example illustrates writing a Mapworks Studio web application to customise:

1. Mouseover, tooltip and mouse-click events & display customisation; and
2. The webapp initiated *zoom to feature* operation with a custom marker to
   highlight the point feature centred on the map. 
   In this example, each time this operation s a random feature is chosen 

The use case also includes Mapworks user auth within the Angular framework.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.0.0.

## Application configuration

As configured, this example web application makes use of the following Mapworks resources:

- Organisation: https://app.mapworks.io/
- Application: [Mapworks Example Application](https://app.mapworks.io/settings/application/an0raTjbw6A6Kno8s8Bw2/details)
- Map: [OpenStreetMap](https://app.mapworks.io/content/#/map/AXBR6sWIAAA2ac12AAAA) (`map-osm-public`)

The application configuration (in [src/app/app.config.ts](src/app/app.config.ts)) is as follows:

```ts
export const appConfig = {
  mapworksOrgUrl: 'https://app.mapworks.io',
  client_id: '3mvor82v8k8f6nbi4f8bpihsom',
  mapRef: 'map-osm-public',
  layerRef: 'ne_10m_populated_places',
};
```

Notes:

1. This application has been configured in the to operation when running locally
   (http://localhost:4200) and when running on CodeSandbox (link above).

2. If the CodeSandbox application is forked (and as a result, will be accessed on a
   different web application URL) the Mapworks Application `client_id` will need to
   updated to an application configured in your Mapworks Organisation.


## Map "feature" events

A Mapworks map provides a multitude of events relating to the user's interaction
with the map. These may be listened to by applications.

We focus on three in this example, being:

1. `feature:mouseover` - an instantaneous event emitted when the mouse pointer passes
   *over* a feature on the map. These are emitted at high volume during map interaction
   and it is often necessary to throttle the rate depending on the application. 

   In this example webapp, the mouseover events are captured, throttled to a rate of 10/second
   and displayed above the map (see (1) below).

2. `feature:tooltip` - a *"brief"* on-map tooltip, displayed after the mouse pointer is hovered 
   (paused in the same location) for a small period. The default tooltip makes use of the
   features **queryable** fields and the **Tooltip Text Format** string (set in *Layer Styles*).

3. `feature:mouseclick` - a *"fuller"* on map display which is shown after the user clicks on
   a feature on the map. The default mouse click display loads all fields for the feature (from
   the Mapworks server) and displays them in tabular form.

As well as the default displays on the map, as described above, each of these events are 
available in code in this example, and the webapp displays them as follows:

<img src="/assets/mapworks-mouse-event-display.png" width="600">

Refer to the following in the code:

- [src/app/main-app/map-events-display.component.ts](src/app/main-app/map-events-display.component.ts) -
  listens to the `MapworksMap` events and displays in the webapp.

The following screenshots demonstrate the *out-of-the-box* behaviour of the Studio map application for
a simple tooltip and mouse-click display for the OSM *Populated Places* layer (as used throughout
this example):

<img src="/assets/default-tooltip.png" width="500">
<img src="/assets/default-mouseclick.png" width="500">


## Mouseover and tooltip customisation

The on-map display for both *tooltips* and *mouse-click* display may be customised.

Additionally, the mouse-click display may include a deferred/asynchronous update which 
enable web applications to obtain further data before updating the display.

In order to perform this customisation, it is neccessary to obtain the instance of the
`MapworksStudioTooltipControl` instance associated with the Studio map, and listen to the 
`before:render` event. This enables access to the context object (containing details
of the feature being displayed etc) to be accessed and the templates to be used for
display to be replaced or modified.

In this example web application:

1. The *tooltip* display utilises an Angular component displayed within the tooltip utilising
   [Angular elements](https://angular.io/guide/elements). See more below.

2. The *mouse-click* display utilises a simulated asychronous load (in this case a 2 second delay)
   and modifies the default tabular display by inserting the Mapworks logo.

The produces:

<img src="/assets/custom-tooltip.png" width="500">

<img src="/assets/custom-mouseclick-loading.png" width="500">

<img src="/assets/custom-mouseclick-loaded.png" width="500">

Note that in all cases, Mapworks take care of the correct positioning the displayed element 
with respect to the feature on the map.

Refer to the following in the code:

- [src/app/main-app/main-app.component.ts](src/app/main-app/main-app.component.ts) - the
  wiring for listening to the `before:render` events, customising the display templates
  and providing the context object to the custom element via `MouseoverDataProvider`.


### Angular elements 

To achieve Angular component-level integration for this example, Angular elements
(web *custom elements*, also called *Web Components*) are utilised.

Mapworks utilises HTML text (as `string`'s within the API) to provide content
for tooltip and mouse-click displays. The use of custom elements enables
the use of Angular components to be used for this use case.

Refer to the following in the code:

- [src/app/mapworks-map.service.ts](src/app/mapworks-map.service.ts) - registers the custom
  element and binds an injector for the `MouseoverDataProvider` class to provide
  the context object supplied by the Studio map event to the Angular component.

- [src/app/mouseover/mouseover.component.ts](src/app/mouseover/mouseover.component.ts) - the
  Angular elements component displayed in the tooltip and mour-click displays.

- [src/app/main-app/main-app.component.ts](src/app/main-app/main-app.component.ts) - the
  wiring for listening to the `before:render` events, customising the display templates
  and providing the context object to the custom element via `MouseoverDataProvider`.


### Standard templates

It may be helpful to refer to the standard Studio templates for tooltips and mouse-click 
displays:

- [docs/default-tooltip-template.md](docs/default-tooltip-template.md) - for displaying tooltips

- [docs/default-mouseclick-template.md](docs/default-mouseclick-template.md) - for displaying mouse-clicks


## Webapp initiated *Zoom to feature*

This part of the the example webapp performs the following:

1. Random selection of a map feature from within the OSM *Populated Places* layer.

2. Initiation of a smooth, animated *zoom to feature* operation to centre the map
   on the location of the selected feature.

3. Placement of a custom marker, utilising an animated SVG, to highlight the
   feature on the map. Refer to the SVG [marker](/assets/marker.svg) icon used:

   <img src="/assets/marker-example.png" width="200">

Refer to the following in the code:

- [src/app/main-app/map-events-display.component.ts](src/app/main-app/map-events-display.component.ts) -
  the `doZoomTo()` method which initiates the animated zoom to (using the Studio API).

- [src/app/main-app/map-point-marker.class.ts](src/app/main-app/map-point-marker.class.ts) - 
  the implementation of a Studio `FeatureReporter` to display the marker icon on the map.


## Using the Mapworks code

The [src/app/mapworks](src/app/mapworks) subfolder may be copied and used directly in web application code.

- [src/app/mapworks](src/app/mapworks) - this contains the `MapworksMapService` class used to manage auth and map initialisation.
- [src/main.ts](src/main.ts) - contains code to handle the OAuth2/OIDC callback used as part of the sign in process (this will need to be incorporated or use `login-callback.html`)
- [src/assets/login-callback.html](src/assets/login-callback.html) - this handles the OAuth2/OIDC callback used as part of the sign in process (preferred in non-CodeSandbox environments)

Note that due to constraints of the CodeSandbox environment, the OAuth2/OIDC callback is handled in [src/main.ts](src/main.ts) - for non-CodeSandbox you are probably better utilising the static `login-callback.html` (`app-config.ts` needs to be updated to reflect this).
